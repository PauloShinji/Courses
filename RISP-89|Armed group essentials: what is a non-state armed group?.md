<h3 id="abstract">Abstract:</h3>
<p>This article also provides data on trends in battle-related deaths since 1989. These data do not show a clear time-trend. However, there is a particular difficulty in mapping the conflict in Syria, for which no credible battle-related deaths in 2013 can yet be reported.</p>
<h3 id="trends">Trends</h3>
<ul>
<li>In 2013, 33 armed conflicts were active in 25 locations worldwide. The number remains at a relatively low level, especially compared to the immediate post-Cold War period. In fact, relative to the peak year of 1991, which saw 52 active conflicts, the number is down by as much as almost 37%</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>seven reached the intensity level of war - conflicts with at least 1,000 battle-related death</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The number of conflict dyads 2 - a measure of fragmentation in an armed conflict - also increased in 2013, going from 40 to 46. The level of fragmentation has not been this high since 2002, and prior to this an equally high figure was only registered four times in the post-1946 period7</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>This may have negative implications for peacemaking, since research has shown that a high number of rebel organizations leads to more intractable conflicts,</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Armed Conflict:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>a contested incompatibility that concerns government or territory or both where the use of armed force between two parties results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in a year. Of these two parties, at least one has to be the government of a state."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The conflicts are divided according to type of conflict. <strong>Interstate armed conflict</strong> occurs between two or more states. <strong>Internationalized internal armed conflict</strong> occurs between the government of a state and internal opposition groups, with intervention from other states in the form of troops. <strong>Internal armed conflict</strong> occurs between the government of a state and internal opposition group"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The conflicts are also divided according to their intensity into two categories: <strong>Minor armed conflict</strong> : at least 25 battle-related deaths in a year but fewer than 1,000. <strong>War</strong> : at least 1,000 battle-related deaths in a year."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>UCDP codes three different fatality estimate - low, best and high - based on the reliability of reports and the conflicting number of deaths that can be reported for any violent event. Low estimate: The UCDP Low estimate consists of the aggregated low estimates for all battle-related incidents during a year. If different reports provide different estimates and a higher estimate is considered more reliable, the low estimate is also reported if deemed reasonable. Best estimate : The UCDP Best estimate consist of the aggregated most reliable numbers for all battle-related incidents during a year. If different reports provide different estimates, an examination is made as to which source is most reliable. If no such distinction can be made, UCDP as a rule includes the lower figure given. High estimate : The UCDP High estimate consists of the aggregated high estimates for all battlerelated incidents during a year. If different reports provide different estimates and a lower estimate is considered more or equally reliable, the high estimate is also reported if deemed reasonable."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dyad:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>A dyad is defined as a pair of warring parties. In interstate conflicts, these warring parties are governments of states, whereas in intrastate conflicts, one is the government and the other is a rebel group. If more than one rebel group is active in a conflict, several dyads are recorded</li>
